# PS4a: Checkers

## Contact
Name:       Thomas O'Connor
Section:    202
Time to Complete:   4 Hours


## Description
Created a Checkers game class that displays the default game configuration on startup.
When clicking on pawns, highlights selected pawns.
Clicking elsewhere deselects the pawns.

### Features
Created an initialize function that sets up the board in the default configuration
Created a mouseInGameBounds helper function that detects when the cursor is within
the bounds of the checkerboard arena, excluding the decorative border.
Created a selectPiece function that checks for the current player's turn,
and changes currentGameState memory to reflect selected pieces.

### Memory
Used no smart pointers - used a 2D array to store game state

### Lambdas
Used no Labmdas or algorithms

### Issues
Works properly

### Extra Credit
Not for extra credit, but added a shortcut (X) that closes the window
Added game border using wood texture
Added player indicator, as well as shortcut (T) to artificially change turns
