## Description
This project is supposed to teach the basics of sfml, as well as to ensure that
students correctly implimented their linux ide and other related softwares.

Chose to impliment a scaling feature using the Equal and Hyphen keys.

Everything works as intended.

### Extra Credit
Scaling feature:
(=) Equals key: Increase scale of sprite
(-) Hyphen key: Decrease scale of sprite

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

I believe (b) is most applicable to this class. (b) states: "Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data, including on-line sources, social media, etc. without instructorâ€™s permission;" This is particularly relevant for a coding class such as this one because many of the programs and activities we will be completing are posted online on forums and repositories. This entices students to go to these sources for answers, which defeats the purpose of the assignments. This policy is also even more relevant now than ever thanks to the availability of ai software such as chatgpt which can write code for you. This "fabricated data" allows students to bypass the trial and error process of coding on their own which helps to engrain skills and habits into their heads.
