## Description
Use LFSR to encode and decode images. Use SFML to load and display
the image.

### Features
Created two instances of the same input photo, one to leave as the base photo
and the other to perform the transformation on. This prevents any uneccesary allocs
or copies. 

### Issues
Fully works

### Extra Credit
None
