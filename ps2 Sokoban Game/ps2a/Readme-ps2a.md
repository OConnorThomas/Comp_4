# PS2a: Sokoban

## Contact
Name:               Thomas O'Connor
Section:            202
Time to Complete:   5 hours

## Description
Reads in a text file and generates a graphic window with 
the Sokoban level.

### Features
Chose to impliment structure in row-major order
This is how the program reads the file char by char,
so it made sense for me to leave it in that implimentation

### Memory
Data structure: 2D vector of chars
Did not use smart pointers

### Lambdas
Included no algorithm or lambda expressions

### Issues
I had trouble with vector sizes and reading values into the vector correctly
No issues with the program

### Extra Credit
Implimented an elapsed-time clock in the upper-left hand side of the screen
Created as its own member function, it can easily be implimented or excluded
